PlayDog is a 'Make It Yourself', interactive game for dogs.

It's an experimental product, built of 3D printed parts & off the shelf electronics.
You make it entirely on your own and control it via a dedicated PlayDog App.

Based on principals of operational conditioning, PlayDog uses sound and food coupling,
teaching your dog to act on a melody as it would grant it an edible reward. 
It's built of multiple bases positioned in your home, and it plans random 
running laps from base to base, ending at the feeding base - where, after 
a successful lap, your pet receives a tasty snack.
